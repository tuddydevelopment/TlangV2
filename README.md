# TlangV2
New, turing complete version of Tlang (not TlanG, they are entirely different), which is quite similar to assembly


`java -jar TlangC.jar <file> <[enableDebugCompilation]>`
  to compile

`java -jar Tlang.jar <file>`
  to run

`java -jar TlangD.jar <file>`
  to debug-run


(look at [tudbut/TlangV2-Utils](/tudbut/TlangV2-Utils) for some pre-made functions)
