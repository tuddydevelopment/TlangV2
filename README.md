# TlangV2
New, turing complete version of Tlang (not TlanG, they are entirely different), which is quite similar to assembly


`java -jar TlangC.jar <file> <[enableDebugCompilation]>`
  to compile, outputs binary to <file>.bin

`java -jar Tlang.jar <file>`
  to run, only reads binary

`java -jar TlangD.jar <file>`
  to debug-run, only reads binary


(look at [tudbut/TlangV2-Utils](https://github.com/tudbut/TlangV2-Utils) for some pre-made functions)
